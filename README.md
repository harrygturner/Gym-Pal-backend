## GymPal 
GymPal is your own personal trainer, allowing you create your own gym routines from an open source database. Application allows you to filter exercises by the muscle they target. After you've chosen your exercises go on and decide the order you do them in with our drag and drop functionality. Lastly, insert how many sets and reps you'd like to do and your good to go with your very own personalized gym card. Frontend built using React.js with a backend in Ruby on Rails. 

## Motivation
Ever been in the gym and had no idea what exercise to do next. Well this application is for all those people, discretely searching for 'Best back exercises to do' on their phones and scrolling through Mensfitness in the hope of finding some inspiration. This application allows you to predesign you workout so no more lost souls aimlessly loitering near the benches or the stretching mats.
